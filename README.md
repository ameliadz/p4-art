# P4: a thing about art

## Plans

### Overview:
Art event database using React on Rails. I'd like to use auth and maybe even a map. Picture upload would be cool too. I don't really know how to do any of that. Gonna use info from the [Art Beat API](https://www.nyartbeat.com/resources/doc/api).<br />
**User stories**: My user is Art Paintbrush, and Art would really like to stay in the loop on cool local art events. Maybe he even does art and wants to let people know about his upcoming gallery show. He probably wants to bookmark upcoming events and I bet he'd want to save them to his calendar, but that all seems like a lot so I should probably just pick one thing.<br />
**Timeline**: 6/3 - flesh out idea. 6/4 - build database. 6/7 - present nearly-completed product.<br />
