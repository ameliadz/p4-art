His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.661266"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.661266"]]

The renovation of the Early Gothic Hall also features construction of two new limestone apertures in an interior wall (for the display of grisaille glass windows) and new lighting. The display in this room constitutes the largest and most varied group of 13th- and 14th-century panels outside Europe. Also returned to view are more than a dozen important Gothic sculptures and paintings from the Museum’s permanent collection, including the lifesize Virgin from the choir screen of Strasbourg Cathedral (mid-13th century) and a recently acquired late 13th-century head also from the region of Strasbourg on the Upper Rhine.

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.702873"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.702873"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.720607"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.720607"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.753786"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.753786"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.758420"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:11:41.758420"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

More than 1,200 objects— comprising sculpture, relief, paintings, pottery, and papyri—are now on view, including such treasures as an exquisite chlorite head of a Middle Kingdom princess, an early stone deity from 2650 B.C., a relief from the tomb of a man named Akhty-hotep, and a highly abstract female terracotta statuette created over five thousand years ago."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.245476"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.245476"]]

At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.271398"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.271398"]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn.

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.326718"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.326718"]]

Each of these sculpture/paintings is designed to alter our visual perception of three-dimensional form.\n\nNicole Stager creates her work in the darkroom, drawing with handheld light sources in a process that combines the specificity of photography with the aesthetic of abstract painting. Time, color, shape and line are all uniquely presented in Stager’s work; the final product has far more to do with the interaction of light, shadow and chemistry than with the objects that produced them.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.363205"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.363205"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.368273"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.368273"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time. New, beautifully crafted display cases throughout the 1906 library feature selections from the Morgan's collection of great works of art and literature from the ancient world to modern times. \n\nIn 1966 the secretary of the interior designated Pierpont Morgan's 1906 library a national historic landmark.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.411116"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:12:34.411116"]]

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.050120"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.050120"]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.093742"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.093742"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.140396"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.140396"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.147979"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.147979"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.196484"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:11.196484"]]

Themes of life, death, fertility, regeneration, and spiritual transformation will be explored through pre-Columbian and historical artworks including twenty-one objects that have not been on public view for decades or have never been exhibited. This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.

At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.072016"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.072016"]]

It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.125873"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.125873"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.139204"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.139204"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.190141"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.190141"]]

Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.238536"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:13:47.238536"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.514834"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.514834"]]

The display in this room constitutes the largest and most varied group of 13th- and 14th-century panels outside Europe. Also returned to view are more than a dozen important Gothic sculptures and paintings from the Museum’s permanent collection, including the lifesize Virgin from the choir screen of Strasbourg Cathedral (mid-13th century) and a recently acquired late 13th-century head also from the region of Strasbourg on the Upper Rhine.

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.578087"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.578087"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.592340"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.592340"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.628449"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.628449"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.636816"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:16:53.636816"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.005812"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.005812"]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see.

The exhibition includes erotic works by well known artists like Randy Wray, Gerald Gooch and Alex Rockman donated to the museum by the Peter Norton Family and the Lannan Family Foundation.

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.055516"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.055516"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.089717"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.089717"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.093267"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:19:45.093267"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.098319"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.098319"]]

No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-170}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.136578"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.136578"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.146138"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.146138"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.179338"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.179338"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.184138"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:20:11.184138"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.714350"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.714350"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.782179"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.782179"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.788660"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.788660"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.827784"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.827784"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.835103"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:15.835103"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.252964"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.252964"]]

The new installation highlights the phenomenon of late medieval private devotion. Two new wall cases allow the exhibition of devotional objects formerly seen in the Treasury, and two important 15th-century stained-glass panels—one representing Christ as the Man of Sorrows, the other the Virgin as the Mater Dolorosa—have been installed in the central windows. Acquired in 1998, these panels are on view at The Cloisters for the first time and contribute greatly to the private devotional theme. New, more discreet lighting has been installed and the gallery walls have been re-plastered to match the original color.

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.744086"], ["longitude", "-73.987708"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.301003"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.301003"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.356110"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.356110"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.362783"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.362783"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time. New, beautifully crafted display cases throughout the 1906 library feature selections from the Morgan's collection of great works of art and literature from the ancient world to modern times. \n\nIn 1966 the secretary of the interior designated Pierpont Morgan's 1906 library a national historic landmark. Both the exterior and interior of the library are also designated New York City landmarks."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2011/8E41-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2011/8E41-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2011/8E41-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.749392"], ["longitude", "-73.98175"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.397858"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.397858"]]

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.704489"], ["longitude", "-74.014136"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.408593"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:25:56.408593"]]

This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.860781"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.860781"]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload.

Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn.

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment.

The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963.

As the name implies, the CompostModern forum aims to re-cycle our rich aesthetic history. If the project of postmodernism was to deconstruct traditions, it has left us with a fertile soil out of which new forms may emerge. It is with the belief that all new forms of art must evolve from a history that we approach the guiding question of the forum: What is creativity?

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.958714"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.958714"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", false], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.967002"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:27:46.967002"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time. New, beautifully crafted display cases throughout the 1906 library feature selections from the Morgan's collection of great works of art and literature from the ancient world to modern times. \n\nIn 1966 the secretary of the interior designated Pierpont Morgan's 1906 library a national historic landmark.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.730898"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.730898"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.790223"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.790223"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.795057"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.795057"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.829819"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.829819"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.834843"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:28:48.834843"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.772720"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.772720"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation.

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.874741"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.874741"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.909014"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:48:03.909014"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art.

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time.

Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.532744"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.532744"]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744086"], ["longitude", "-73.987708"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.573478"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.573478"]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.584294"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.584294"]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.589556"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.589556"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.719194"], ["longitude", "-73.999008"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.622381"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.622381"]]

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.628077"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.628077"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-170}"], ["price", 0], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.704489"], ["longitude", "-74.014136"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.668023"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:50:48.668023"]]

Themes of life, death, fertility, regeneration, and spiritual transformation will be explored through pre-Columbian and historical artworks including twenty-one objects that have not been on public view for decades or have never been exhibited. This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.696590"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.696590"]]

The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn.

The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R.

Finally, “Tracing the Figure” charts the enduring artistic interest in the human figure, from portraits that place an individual in a clearly defined place and time to timeless abstractions of the human form.\n\n[Image: Frans Hals &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; Oil on canvas 29 x 21 3/4 in.]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/3DB5-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/3DB5-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/3DB5-170}"], ["price", "Suggested Contributions: Adults $10, Seniors and Students $6, Members and Children under 12 and First Saturday of the month 5pm to 11pm Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.774776"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.774776"]]

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", "Adults $10, Seniors and Students $5, Children under 12 in groups less than 10 and MOCA Members: Free.

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", "Suggested Contributions: Adults $10, Seniors and Students $6, Members and Children under 12 and First Saturday of the month 5pm to 11pm Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.799245"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 19:52:02.799245"]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time. New, beautifully crafted display cases throughout the 1906 library feature selections from the Morgan's collection of great works of art and literature from the ancient world to modern times. \n\nIn 1966 the secretary of the interior designated Pierpont Morgan's 1906 library a national historic landmark.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.778927"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.778927"], ["venue_id", 3]]

Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn.

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.836757"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.836757"], ["venue_id", 3]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", "Adults $22, Students and Seniors $18, Members and Children under 12 Free, Saturday pay what you wish 5:45-7:45 (last ticket issued at 7:15)"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.842279"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.842279"], ["venue_id", 10]]

Each of these sculpture/paintings is designed to alter our visual perception of three-dimensional form.\n\nNicole Stager creates her work in the darkroom, drawing with handheld light sources in a process that combines the specificity of photography with the aesthetic of abstract painting. Time, color, shape and line are all uniquely presented in Stager’s work; the final product has far more to do with the interaction of light, shadow and chemistry than with the objects that produced them.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", "Adults $10, Seniors and Students $5, Children under 12 in groups less than 10 and MOCA Members: Free.

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", "Suggested Contributions: Adults $10, Seniors and Students $6, Members and Children under 12 and First Saturday of the month 5pm to 11pm Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.884444"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.884444"], ["venue_id", 2]]

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-170}"], ["price", "Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.704489"], ["longitude", "-74.014136"], ["created_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.928509"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-04 21:06:51.928509"], ["venue_id", 20]]

Themes of life, death, fertility, regeneration, and spiritual transformation will be explored through pre-Columbian and historical artworks including twenty-one objects that have not been on public view for decades or have never been exhibited. This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:13:09.309683"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:13:09.309683"], ["venue_id", 3]]

Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey proposes that Jews have been able to sustain their identity, despite wide dispersion and sometimes tragic circumstances, by evolving a culture that can adapt to life in many countries and under various conditions.

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload.

Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever.

Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn.

From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["price", "Adults $10, Seniors and Students $5, Children under 12 in groups less than 10 and MOCA Members: Free.

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["price", "Suggested Contributions: Adults $10, Seniors and Students $6, Members and Children under 12 and First Saturday of the month 5pm to 11pm Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:13:09.420257"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:13:09.420257"], ["venue_id", 2]]

Adjacent to Morgan's home, which stood on the corner of Madison Avenue and 36th Street, McKim created a majestic structure in a classical style based upon villas of the Italian Renaissance. The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses. Completed in 1906, Mr. Morgan's Library—as it was called for many years—is the historic heart of today's Morgan Library &amp; Museum.\n\nIn 2010 the Morgan restored the interior of the 1906 library to its original grandeur. A new lighting system was installed to illuminate the extraordinary murals and decor of the four historic rooms. Intricate marble surfaces and applied ornamentation were cleaned, period furniture was reupholstered, and original fixtures—including three chandeliers removed decades ago—were restored and reinstalled. A late-nineteenth-century Persian rug (similar to the one originally there) was laid in the grand East Room. The ornate ceiling of the librarian's office, or North Room, was cleaned, and visitors are able to enter the refurbished space—now a gallery—for the first time. New, beautifully crafted display cases throughout the 1906 library feature selections from the Morgan's collection of great works of art and literature from the ancient world to modern times. \n\nIn 1966 the secretary of the interior designated Pierpont Morgan's 1906 library a national historic landmark.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas.

His father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, was the co-founder of Tiffany &amp; Company, the luxury retailer best known for fine silver and jewelry. At an early age Tiffany was exposed to superbly-designed and expertly-crafted objets d’art, undoubtedly stimulating his love and appreciation for exceptional objects and setting him on a self-proclaimed “quest for beauty.”\n\nTiffany began his career as a landscape painter but eventually branched out into interior design and the decorative arts. Over the years he formed a number of companies in both Manhattan and Queens that manufactured leaded-glass windows, lamps, mosaics, glassware, enamels, ceramics, metalwork, furniture, and textiles. These works were available at his Manhattan showroom and in fine retail and jewelry stores throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTiffany embarked on the production of lamps in the early 1890s. Although the light bulb was patented in 1879, electricity was not widely available until shortly after the turn of the century and even then only the wealthy could afford it. Tiffany’s earliest lamps, made of blown glass or leaded-glass and bronze, were fueled by kerosene. As electric light became affordable and gained popularity, Tiffany began offering his clients the choice of either oil or electric lamps.\n\nOne of the earliest serious collectors of Tiffany lamps, Dr. Neustadt assembled an encyclopedic collection which included desk, reading, library, and floor lamps as well as hanging shades and chandeliers. He also added leaded-glass windows and bronze desk sets to his collection. In 1967, he acquired some 500 crates of sheet and pressed glass made and used by the Tiffany Studios which were left over after the company went bankrupt in the early 1930s."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/3738-170}"], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.578193"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.578193"], ["venue_id", 3]]

Everywhere we look we are bombarded with images often to the point of sensory overload. Images shape our desires, the way we think and the manner in which we connect and interact with the world around us. Images serve as the driving force behind decisions about what to buy, what to believe, what to value, where to go and which people and relationships are worth our time and energy. These images come flying at us in commercials, music videos, television shows, mainstream film and in Internet spam. It is impossible to ignore the sensuality and sexuality of these images…and why should we?\n\nAction: Sex and the Moving Image opening at the Museum of Sex in March 2007, traces the way sex and sexual imagery have impacted film, television, advertising and more contemporary outlets like the internet while simultaneously creating the multi- billion dollar porn industry and influencing popular art such as film, social standards, mores and behaviors.\n\nSex on film propelled the development of video technologies such as beta players, VCRS, and DVD players that have brought movies of all types into our homes. The Internet, the latest of this stream of technologies, has made sexual imagery more accessible than ever. No matter how much it is discussed, denounced, and demonized sex on film, sex on our televisions, sex on our computer screens and now sex on our mobile devices is here to stay.\n\nSex, nudity, and innuendo have always been a source of controversy and topics of public discourse and debate. Throughout the history of moving images legislation has affected not only what filmmakers could create, but also what people were “allowed” to see. Sex on film has been banned, censored, edited, and destroyed by those deeming the content to be obscene or immoral. Action: Sex and the Moving Image surveys the history of sex and the moving image over more than 150 years, featuring everything from sex symbols to “sexploitation” films of the 1950s to “porn chic” to contemporary celebrity “home-made” porn. The exhibition aims at providing the tools to become literate in the barrage of sexual driven images in our society.\n\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/0088-170}"], ["price", "Adults $17.50, Students and Seniors $15.25"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744086"], ["longitude", "-73.987708"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.626449"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.626449"], ["venue_id", 9]]

The exhibition includes erotic works by well known artists like Randy Wray, Gerald Gooch and Alex Rockman donated to the museum by the Peter Norton Family and the Lannan Family Foundation. Highlights of the technology collection include homemade contraptions and commercial devices registered with the U.S. Patent Office that prevent, improve or enhance sexual function. Dan Siechert's &quot;Monkey Rocker&quot; or Abyss Creations LLC's &quot;Real Doll&quot; are just a few of the exhibits featured.\n\nThe gallery development team, lead by John Vollmer and Karen Eckhaus of the Museum of Sex, includes several leading authorities from a wide range of disciplines: Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington, St. Louis serves as a key advisor for &quot;Sex Education America.&quot; Joshua Berger and Sarah Dougher, authors of the (award-winning) book, XXX: The Power of Sex in Contemporary Design, have curated &quot;Stimulating Sales: Sex and Design.&quot;\n\nAndrea Tone, Canada Research Chair in the Social History of Medicine Social Studies of Medicine &amp; Department of History at McGill University, and Rachel Maines, Researcher at Cornell University, offer commentary in &quot;Sex and Technology.&quot; Dr. Joseph Slade, Professor at the School of Telecommunications, Ohio University and advisor on the exhibition, Stag, Smokers, and Blue Movies, helped to plan the exhibits in &quot;American pornography&quot; which are drawn from the Museum of Sex's Ralph Whittington collection.\n\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/2F1D-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/2F1D-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/2F1D-170}"], ["price", "Adults $17.50, Students and Seniors $15.25"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744086"], ["longitude", "-73.987708"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.632452"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.632452"], ["venue_id", 9]]

To celebrate the immense and intricate inner-workings of the City, various agencies were invited to produce exhibitions for the New York City Pavilion (now the Queens Museum of Art). The Board of Water Supply (today's Department of Environmental Protection) commissioned the Cartographic Survey Force of the Works Progress Administration to create a magnificent scale model of the New York City watershed, a relief map measuring almost 700 square feet and weighing 10,000 pounds. Tracing the City's water supply system from the outermost, upstream tributaries of the Delaware River to sea level at the Nassau County line, the watershed model identified the various aqueducts, water shafts and drainage basins that feed the City's water supply.\n\nqmaDue to space limitations within the New York City Pavilion, the model was never exhibited in its entirety. After nearly 70 years in storage, the 27 completed panels were in desperate need of conservation. Through a collaboration between The Queens Museum of Art and the Department of Environmental Protection, the plaster and wood relief map was sent to McKay Lodge Fine Arts Conservation Lab in Oberlin, Ohio for one year of treatment. In time for its 70th anniversary, the model has been restored to its original brilliance and returns to its intended home in the New York City Building where it will remain on long-term loan. In celebration, the QMA and DEP will commemorate this momentous homecoming with an exhibition featuring the model, historic documentation, and contemporary photographs of the New York City watershed."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2008/FB1E-170}"], ["price", "Suggested donations: Adults $5, Seniors and Children $2.50, Members and Children under 5 Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.744969"], ["longitude", "-73.84685"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.638037"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.638037"], ["venue_id", 3]]

Thannhauser (1892–1976) was the son of art dealer Heinrich Thannhauser (1859–1935), who founded the Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. From an early age, Thannhauser worked alongside his father in the flourishing gallery and helped to build an impressive and versatile exhibition program that included the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Italian Futurists, and regularly featured contemporary German artists. The Moderne Galerie presented the premier exhibitions of the New Artists’ Association of Munich (Neue Künstlervereinigung München) and The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), both of which included Vasily Kandinsky, in 1901 and 1911, respectively. Kandinsky later described the gallery’s rooms as “perhaps the most beautiful exhibition spaces in all of Munich.” The Moderne Galerie also mounted the first major Pablo Picasso retrospective in 1913, thus initiating the close relationship between Justin K. Thannhauser and Picasso that lasted until the artist’s death in 1973.\n\nThe Thannhausers’ commitment to promoting artistic progress paralleled the vision of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949). In appreciation of this shared spirit, and in the memory of his first wife and two sons—who might have continued in the family’s art trade had they not died at tragically young ages—Thannhauser gave a significant portion of his art collection, including over 30 works by Picasso, to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1963. From 1965 until Thannhauser’s death in 1976 (when his collection formally entered the Guggenheim’s holdings), the Thannhauser Collection was on long-term loan to the museum. A bequest of 10 additional works received after Hilde Thannhauser’s death in 1991 enhanced the legacy of this family of important art dealers.\n\nOrganized by Tracey Bashkoff."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/C1AA-170}"], ["price", "Adults $22, Students and Seniors $18, Members and Children under 12 Free, Saturday pay what you wish 5:45-7:45 (last ticket issued at 7:15)"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.782925"], ["longitude", "-73.959369"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.643815"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.643815"], ["venue_id", 10]]

Each of these sculpture/paintings is designed to alter our visual perception of three-dimensional form.\n\nNicole Stager creates her work in the darkroom, drawing with handheld light sources in a process that combines the specificity of photography with the aesthetic of abstract painting.

Metaphorically and literally, this “heart” will ground visitors, and be the focal point of the “new MOCA experience.”  This presentation is an innovative approach to museum and exhibition design.  It will facilitate a new way of interacting with content: through the evocative use of space that stirs visitors’ emotion and breaks down barriers to deeper learning and understanding.\n\nThe core exhibition presents the diverse layers of the Chinese American experience while examining America’s journey as a nation of immigrants—from an historical overview of Chinese immigration to the United States, to the individual stories that reveal what it has meant to be Chinese in America at different moments in time, to the physical traces and images left behind by past generations for us to consider, reflect and reclaim.\n\nA key element of the exhibition is its dialogue with Maya Lin’s architectural centerpiece – a sky lit courtyard at the heart of the museum. The exhibit wraps around and engages with the courtyard, which represents the idea of China – a collective origin, which for many after the first generation, becomes a constructed, rather than an actual, memory. Not unlike the rooms of a Chinese house, each section of the exhibit is connected to the courtyard via portals. Each one containing films of people narrating personal life stories, demonstrating how history is propelled by individual moments of decision-making in the face of circumstances larger than themselves. External walls dialogue with the inner, in order to provide the larger historical context for Chinese American struggles and achievements.\n\nThematically and chronologically, the exhibit reveals the complex layers of the Chinese American experience through six modules:\n\n1) Go East! Go West!  examines how the flow and exchange of goods and people helped shape the formation of new identities, ideas, and perceptions of both Chinese and Americans during the 19th century.\n\n2) America: Staking Claims explores the political climate in America leading up to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its impact as the first federal law to restrict the immigration of a specific group based on nationality, defining in legal terms who could not “become American.”\n\n\n3) Greetings from Chinatown shows how by the turn of the century, Chinatowns had sprung up in cities all across America forming an important economic and social network for Chinese Americans, as well as sites of cultural exchange in America’s urban centers.\n\n4) Allies, Enemies? looks at how conflicts abroad dictated the fortunes of Chinese Americans at home.  While World War II brought about the eventual repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, China’s Communist revolution fueled Red Scare targeting of Chinese in America.\n\n5) Seeds of Change presents the great shifts in Chinese American communities during the latter half of the 20th century. The landmark Immigration Reform of 1965 helped revitalize and diversify the Chinese population, and a second generation of Chinese Americans came of age in a time of cultural activism and community organizing.\n\n6) Made in America!? explores how globalization has transformed American culture as much as the circulation of American culture has influenced peoples and nations outside the U.S., and while globalization promotes new and complex versions of national identity, it also creates conditions for expressions of ethnicity and identity politics.\n"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/B4FD-170}"], ["price", "Adults $10, Seniors and Students $5, Children under 12 in groups less than 10 and MOCA Members: Free.

Since its opening in January 2005, the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center has housed approximately 2,100 objects in two types of storage units: vitrined cases and paintings screens. The facility also contains forty-two drawers for storage. Beginning in mid-October and in stages over subsequent months, they will be filled with works from the Museum’s renowned American holdings and opened to the public. Once the drawers are full, the number of objects on view in visible storage will rise to 2,500—an increase of almost 20 percent.\n\nThe drawers’ contents will encompass a variety of objects from the Americas—including art of the United States as well as of the indigenous and colonial peoples of North and South America—and dating from the pre-Columbian period to the present day. Although the works range widely in terms of medium, date, function, and geographical origin, they do share a diminutive scale and suitability for flat storage. Among the objects that will be installed in the drawers are: American and Hopi ceramic tiles; Mexican pottery stamps; jewelry and other ornaments from Native and South American cultures; Modernist jewelry; silverplated flatware and serving pieces; Spanish Colonial devotional objects; American portrait and mourning miniatures; commemorative medals; and embroidery. As in other sections of the Luce Visible Storage ▪ Study Center, objects in the drawers are densely installed to maximize the available space and are grouped by type, medium, or culture. Visitors can learn more about the works by using one of the nearby computer kiosks in the facility, or by accessing the Luce database online. To obtain a list of a drawer’s entire contents, use the Map feature and select numbers 41 through 47.\n\nHeld in conjunction with the drawers installation, Small Wonders from the American Collections features an eclectic selection of seventy works of art on the walls and in the display cases above the drawers. This exhibition both highlights objects that will be installed in the drawers and reveals a diversity of cultural traditions and artistic practices that constitute American art. A variety of jewelry and objects of personal adornment—although produced by different peoples—function similarly to signify information about the wearer’s identity. Flatware, pins, and other silver items on display reflect a broad array of forms, styles, and uses for this valuable metal. Ceramic tiles made contemporaneously by Native and non-Native Americans provide an interesting cross-cultural comparison with respect to the decoration and marketing of these wares.\n\n[Image: Unknown Artist &quot;Fan&quot; (1822–31) Ivory sticks and painted paper mount. ]"], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2009/91C9-170}"], ["price", "Suggested Contributions: Adults $10, Seniors and Students $6, Members and Children under 12 and First Saturday of the month 5pm to 11pm Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.671525"], ["longitude", "-73.962556"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.685015"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.685015"], ["venue_id", 2]]

The exterior is constructed of Tennessee pink marble, the blocks set with such precision that virtually no mortar was used. A simple recessed portico is flanked by a pair of stone lionesses.

Scheduled to open on April 19, 2012, Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn, on long-term view in the newly renovated Great Hall, near the main entrance, provides for the first time a dynamic and welcoming introduction to the Museum's extensive collections, which range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture around the world, both past and present. \n\n&quot;This remarkable cross-collection presentation, built around some of the most exceptional works in the Museum, better enables the visitor to explore the collection galleries by providing a model of how to make connections between cultures and how to better understand the ways that different peoples have addressed many of the same issues throughout time,&quot; states Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman. &quot;For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum.&quot; \n\n&quot;Over the course of the twentieth century, the Museum collected on a grand scale, making works of art that had previously been reserved primarily for the elite available to the public. As works of art became available to the many rather than the few, their meanings often changed. Deconstructing those meanings on a basic level provides an understanding of the Brooklyn Museum's collections as a resource for study,&quot; comments Chief Curator Kevin L. Stayton, who has coordinated the presentation, working with the Museum's curators. \n\nThe installation is organized around three main sections: &quot;Connecting Places,&quot; &quot;Connecting People,&quot; and 'Connecting Things.&quot; In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them; and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Places&quot; section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality. The landscapes in which people live and the elements of nature that surround them deeply affect the way people see the world and how they try to understand the universe. This section includes a four-legged bowl (circa 250-600 C.E.), made in what is now Guatemala, that reveals a Mayan concept of the cosmos; an eighteenth-century cosmic diagram, made in Gujarat or Rajasthan, that presents a unique worldview; the monumental 1765 painting Our Lady of Chocharcas Under the Baldachin showing the celebration of a pilgrimage in which Lake Titicaca is almost as significant as the statue of the Virgin herself; a festival hat, probably made around Potosi in the eighteenth century, depicting a triangular mountain that might be the Cerro de Potosi, the source of the silver that enriched the area; Louis Rémy Mignon's monumental painting Niagara (1866), which became a powerful symbol of natural resources that made their potential seem almost limitless; the renowned Century Vase made by the Union Porcelain Works of Brooklyn for display at the Centennial Exposition, in 1876, displaying native animals and scenes of progress unique to the American experience; and a contemporary work, Soundsuit by Nick Cave, that explores man's involvement with nature. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting People&quot; section investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures through time. A number of the works address the journey from life to death, such as a stunning and rare Huastec stone statue that features a standing human figure on one side and a skeleton on the other. Other works include a kachina doll, in the Brooklyn Museum collection since 1904, that reflects the ways in which the human form can represent the spiritual and universal; and Gaston Lachaise's monumental Standing Woman, a modern work that dignifies the human form and raises it to a level that reflects the humanist tradition. \n\nThe &quot;Connecting Things&quot; section includes works that carry particular significance to those who make and use them. Among the objects is a group of more than 100 pitchers to illustrate the many permutations of a single form; kero cups used in ritualistic ceremonies that were important to the Andean concept of reciprocity; a coffin in the form of a Nike sneaker, by Ghanaian artist Paa Joe, that reflects the importance of consumer society and global trade in the modern world; and an African staff, a symbol of authority that is the model for an African-American emancipation cane.

Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\n\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\n\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\n\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."], ["images", "{http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-30,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-80,http://www.nyartbeat.com/media/event/2012/3B15-170}"], ["price", "Free"], ["permanent", true], ["latitude", "40.704489"], ["longitude", "-74.014136"], ["created_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.732350"], ["updated_at", "2019-06-05 01:14:17.732350"], ["venue_id", 20]]

Themes of life, death, fertility, regeneration, and spiritual transformation will be explored through pre-Columbian and historical artworks including twenty-one objects that have not been on public view for decades or have never been exhibited. This long-term installation, which will open on January 18, will be on display in the Museum’s recently re-opened galleries on the fifth floor adjacent to American Identities. \n\nHighlights include the Huastec Life-Death Figure, a carved stone statue that juxtaposes images of life and death and is one of the finest of its kind; the Kwakwaka’wakw Thunderbird Transformation Mask (pictured), a carved wood mask in the form of an ancestral being that opens to reveal a second, human face; and two eight-foot-tall, carved nineteenth-century Heiltsuk house posts made to support the huge beams of a great Northwest Coast plank house. Other featured objects include examples from the extensive Hopi and Zuni kachina collection; masks from all over the Americas; Aztec and Maya sculptures; pre-Columbian gold ornaments; and ancient Andean textiles including the two-thousand-year-old Paracas Textile, the most famous piece in the Museum’s Andean collection, which illustrates the way in which early cultures of Peru’s South Coast envisioned their relationship with nature and the supernatural realm. \n\nAmong the objects that have rarely been on public view are a full-body bark-cloth mask made by the Pami’wa of Colombia and Brazil; a Paracas painted textile mask that was most likely associated with a mummy bundle; a Northwest Coast Kwakwaka’wakw Wild Man Mask by John Livingston; a Maya effigy vessel in the form of a hunchback wearing a jaguar skin; a large, elaborately-painted Paracas jar; a Maya warrior figure with removable headdress; two contemporary kachinas by the Hopi carver Henry Shelton; Anasazi and Valdivia clay figurines, the oldest types found in North and South America; Paracas textile fragments from South America; an aquamarine grasshopper pendant from Mexico; ceramic bird whistles from Costa Rica and Panama; Moche stirrup-spout vessels from Peru; and a large, woven Apache basket with spirit figures. \n\nLife, Death and Transformation in the Americas is organized by Nancy Rosoff, Andrew W. Mellon Curator, Arts of the Americas, Brooklyn Museum; and Susan Kennedy Zeller, Associate Curator, Native American Art, Brooklyn Museum. \n\nThis installation will be accompanied by a series of educational programs to be announced at a later date.
